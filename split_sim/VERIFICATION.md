# Packaging verification

Checked 2026-11-07 from a new clone of main `c967e27`, with no live simulation or
Jetson installation changes:

- `python3 split_sim/doctor.py --source-only`: every prerequisite present; 32
  manifest-listed frozen runtime files match exact SHA-256.
- `python3 -m unittest split_sim.test_install -v`: 2 passed, including complete copy
  into a fresh space-containing folder and missing-prerequisite rejection.
- Host transport/admission/prepared-recorder tests: 16 passed.
- Frozen runtime tests: 13 passed, 1 skipped because the private failed-flight ULog
  is intentionally not distributed. The skip is not a synthetic pass.
- 13 shell syntax checks; 58 Python compilation checks; Docker Compose config parse
  passed. The command parsed config only, without starting containers.
- `bash split_sim/setup_jetson.sh --dry-run`: source checks and printed plan;
  no SSH/Docker action.
- `python3 split_sim/make_assets.py /tmp/navless-install-generated-assets`: public
  repository source generated the split camera/course assets successfully.
- Preview partner verified actual synthetic SQLite→onboard MP4/JPEG/manifest,
  OpenGL chase MP4 from generated public course assets, HTTP UI/catalog/JPEG,
  byte ranges206/416, POST501 and symlink containment; JS/Python syntax passed.

No heavy image/PX4 build, vendor-image provisioning, remote copy, CUDA test,
simulator lifecycle, arming or flight was performed for this packaging review.
No clean-install full-course success is claimed. The included213553 baseline
stopped airborne at the elevated sill on an overly strict conditional-range gate
while EV/baro remained healthy; corrected height/forward-window work must be referenced
separately before those variants are selected.

An additional shallow clone of the published GitHub branch into a new directory
containing spaces passed source doctor and installer dry-run. It did not use
workspace-only files.

## Height follow-up remote clean checkout

Verified the actual published follow-up head `ffb3949` using a fresh depth-one
network clone into a path containing spaces (no local workspace copy):
source doctor verified all 38 runtime members; `setup_jetson.sh --dry-run`
performed no Docker/SSH operation; install and height suites passed 6 tests;
runtime suite passed 21 with one optional retained-ULog/pyulog skip; transport
framing passed 4 tests. `preview/smoke.py` passed synthetic SQLite → H.264
MP4/poster/manifest, catalog classification, HTTP/UI, byte ranges and symlink
exclusion. No simulator, PX4, Jetson, hardware or dependency build was run.
This is clean-source/test/preview verification, not a fresh full-stack build
or flight qualification. First moving attempt failed early yaw integrity;
sill/window behavior remains unqualified and the next flight result pending.
